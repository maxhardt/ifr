# Effect of testing bias on the estimation of the Infection Fatality Rate

Biased (preferential) testing refers to the increased odds in getting tested as an infected subject against getting tested as a non-infected subject. This can lead to overestimation of the infected population and hence the underestimation of the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). Using Bayesian prior on the testing bias, this project attempts to illustrate this effect based on current data from selected countries.
